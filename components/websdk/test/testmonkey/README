TestMonkey
Automated HTML and Javascript Unit Test Framework

WARNING: This is brand new spanking code and is not yet stable and should be used with precaution. 

Look in the tests folder for the manifest.js file for an example of a set of suites.

Each test suite has one or more tests.  Each test has one or more test assertions.

For each assertion, there are some built-in assertion helpers:

- assert: generic assertion
- assertVisible: assert that visibility:visible
- assertHidden: assert that visibility:hidden
- assertDisabled: assert that the element is disabled
- assertEnabled: assert that the element is enabled
- assertCSS: assert a CSS value, for example a border
- assertValue: assert the value of an element, usually a form element
- assertText: assert the text value of an element
- assertAttr: assert an element's attribute value
- assertClass: assert that an element has a specific CSS class
- assertHTML: assert that an element's HTML equals a specific value
- assertEmpty: assert that an element is empty (no children)
- assertChecked: assert that a checkbox is checked
- assertUnchecked: assert that a checkbox is unchecked

You use the assertions with a jQuery selector.  For example:

$('#my_div').assertHidden();

or

$('#my_div').assertCSS('border','1px solid red');


You can introduce your own new assertion types by calling the function 
TestMonkey.installAssertionType.  Example for empty:

TestMonkey.installAssertionType('Empty',function(testcase,assertion,args)
{
	return [this.text()=='',this.text()];
});
